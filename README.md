# Charity-DB

Welcome to Charity-DB! This project contains SQL queries written to query a charity's database for key insights to help meet fundraising objectives for the following year.

## Data Source

The database was obtained from entrylevel.net and it contains two tables: 'donation data' and 'donors data'. When merged together, they contain 1000 records and 15 attributes. The dataset contains information about registered donors to the charity, including details such as state, ID, first name, last name, email addresses, gender, job field, donor's state, donations, and donation frequency. Additional information about the donors is available in the 'donors data' dataset.
